# Sports Club System

an assignment task from school meant to be completed in Java - but I wrote it in python.

I finished this project before the skills required to complete the assignment are taught, meaning that all OOP utilised in here are self-taught. 

## Running instructions

After cloning repository, please run ```main.py``` through Run button on VSCode or type in
```bash
python main.py
```
in terminal to run the code.
